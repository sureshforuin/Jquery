			        "description": "Citadels multi-strategy framework and diverse skill set helps the fund generate alpha in multiple market environments. The manager attempts to construct attractive risk / return investments in various market conditions, while avoiding directional exposure. Therefore, performance will more likely be a factor of idiosyncratic, relative value relationships opposed to the directional behavior of broader markets. An environment characterized by low correlation and high dispersion in equities, along with different interest rate perspectives in fixed income should lead to increased alpha opportunities."

			        "description": "Clearly 2008 was an extremely challenging environment for Citadel. Arbitrage strategies are generally relied upon to provide alpha irrespective of market direction, but suffered in 2008 particularly beginning in September, as a combination of deleveraging, fundamental shocks and short-selling restrictions impacted performance. A key reason that these presumably market neutral strategies suffered was that this market downturn centered on financial institutions. The health of financials institutions is particularly important to relative value arbitrage and market neutral strategies because: 1) they are leverage providers, and 2) they conduct overlapping proprietary trading activities. The de-leveraging across financial institutions, combined with crowdedness of arbitrage strategies, made it difficult to protect capital in 2008."

			        "description": "Investment in technology: Several of Citadels strategies, including replication books that enhance returns, would be difficult for other firms to replicate given the necessary large-scale investment in technology and quantitative modeling. In this regard, Citadel is similar to D.E. Shaw and Renaissance.\n\nRisk management: Citadel implements a strict philosophy with regard to systematic exposures and has developed a framework with the necessary components to effectively manage an operation of this scale and complexity. Ken Griffin is highly involved in this process, acting as a strong enforcer of volatility targets (as well as minimum and maximum volatility levels). Risk management extends beyond evaluating market exposures, to include ensuring the stability of the business in every facet, including such things as disaster recovery and the stability of financing.\n\nEconomies of scale: Given Citadels large balance sheet and high transaction volume, the firm benefits from its allocation of fee revenue to the Street. This includes favorable financing rates, and terms, better than average access to information, low transaction costs, and favorable allocations in competitive offerings."

Business heads are assigned an upper and lower volatility band in dollar terms.  Due to a desire to reflect the current market conditions, Citadel uses a one-year historical unweighted look-back for its ex ante volatility calculations.  In addition, they conduct sensitivity analysis on the ex-ante volatility by varying the time period and using other VaR measures, such as Monte Carlo analysis.  At the portfolio level, the objective of the Management Committee is for the overall fund to have an annualized volatility of 6-10%.  Capital is allocated assuming a .15 average correlation among the business units.  A great deal of sensitivity analysis is applied to the .15 assumption, as it greatly impacts the total amount of dollar volatility allocated to the business units.  \n\nCitadel is cognizant that for most of Citadels businesses, employing historical VaR analysis is generally not sufficient when analyzing and allocating risk.  As a consequence of the inherent limitations of the VaR framework, Citadel overlays a detailed stress historical and testing framework.  Citadel replicates traditional stress scenarios (i.e., 1987 equity, 1998 fixed income, Hurricane Katrina, etc.) at the portfolio level and often applies further modifications to these scenarios to reflect current market dynamics. In addition to historical stress scenarios, Citadel continuously develops new scenarios.  Citadel does not manage to a scenario where each business unit realizes its worst stress simultaneously, but will apply a stress test to one business and generalize that scenario for other businesses.  For example, Citadel has numerous housing shock scenarios that would apply to rates, equities, credit, mortgages, etc.  Citadel will not allow the worst stress scenario to cause greater than a 15% decline in NAV over a 10-day period (assuming no ability to rebalance).  Citadel typically operates at 50% of the max stress allowance (7.5% decline over a 10-day period).  Stress tests are developed based on Management Committee suggestions, as well as directly from PCG given perspective of historical movements in each asset class.  The compensation of the PCG is determined both by not losing more than the volatility and stress forecast, as well as the ability to create new stress scenarios to identify new risks for the trading desk. \n\nThe third component of risk management is liquidity risk.  On a daily basis, the CFO and treasury group are responsible for managing the liquidity of the fund, but the PCG aids the treasury group by modeling the liquidity over time and applying shocks to the asset side of the balance sheet.  These shocks include a) specific mark to market events on assets based on VaR and stress scenarios discussed above; b) changes in prime brokerage and other financing according to the parameters of Citadels funding agreements; c) investor withdrawals.  In determining changes in funding, Citadel looks at historical events (e.g., 1998, 2008) to determine how the Street might change haircuts.  There are also several people within the treasury group at Citadel who have held roles on the sell-side that have information that helps Citadel predict likely outcomes.  With regard to investor withdrawals, Citadel assumes that 70% of quarterly capital investors redeem without regard to penalties and 100% of committed capital investors redeem on their anniversary date.  Citadels liquidity goal is that for the first six months of a crisis, Citadel is in a buying position to take advantage of the dislocation.  At the end of six months, the constraint on liquidating assets is relaxed."

Currently, Citadel believes the fund could generate $2 to $3 billion of liquidity within one month without significant market impact.  \n\nCitadel has likely negotiated as aggressively as any other hedge fund in both term financing and NAV triggers.  For example, Citadels current NAV triggers are at a 50% decline, whereas most hedge funds are in the 20% range.  Additionally, Citadels recent introduction of a MTN program will provide more permanent financing to support the firms liquidity goals.  The firm perceives this as a significant advantage in the event of a market crisis."
