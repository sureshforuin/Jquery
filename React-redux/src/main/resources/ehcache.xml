    Sets the path to the directory where cache files are created.

    If the path is a Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the
    running VM.

    The following properties are translated:
    * user.home - User's home directory
    * user.dir - User's current working directory
    * java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path

    Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one
    -->
    <!-- <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/> -->

    <!--
    Specifies a CacheManagerEventListenerFactory, be used to create a CacheManagerPeerProvider,
    which is notified when Caches are added or removed from the CacheManager.

    The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
    * class - a fully qualified factory class name
    * properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.

    The events include:
    * adding a Cache
    * removing a Cache

    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility
    of the implementer to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues
    depending on what their listener is doing.

    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.

    Mandatory Default Cache configuration. These settings will be applied to caches
    created programmatically using CacheManager.add(String cacheName)
    
    N.B. Hibernate uses these as well if no specific entity settings are found.
